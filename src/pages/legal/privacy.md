## Relevant legal bases

Below you will find an overview of the legal basis of the GDPR on the basis of which we process personal data. Please note that in addition to the provisions of the GDPR, national data protection regulations may apply in your or our country of residence or domicile. Should more specific legal bases be relevant in individual cases, we will inform you of these in the data protection declaration.

* **Contract performance and pre-contractual enquiries (Art. 6 para. 1 cl. 1 lit. b. GDPR)** - Processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party or in order to take steps at the request of the data subject prior to entering into a contract.
*   **Legal obligation (Art. 6 para. 1 cl. 1 lit. c. GDPR)** - processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the controller is subject.
* **Legitimate interests (Art. 6 para.1 cl. 1 lit. f. GDPR)** - processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal data, in particular where the data subject is a child.

In addition to the data protection regulations of the General Data Protection Regulation, national regulations on data protection apply in Germany. These include, in particular, the Act on Protection against Misuse of Personal Data in Data Processing (Federal Data Protection Act - BDSG). In particular, the BDSG contains special regulations on the right to information, the right to erasure, the right to object, the processing of special categories of personal data, the processing for other purposes and the transmission as well as automated decision-making in individual cases including profiling. Furthermore, it regulates data processing for employment purposes (Section 26 BDSG), in particular with regard to the establishment, performance or termination of employment relationships as well as the consent of employees. Furthermore, state data protection laws of the individual federal states may apply.

# Security measures
We take appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of protection appropriate to the risk in accordance with the legal requirements, taking into account the state of the art, the implementation costs and the nature, scope, circumstances and purposes of the processing, as well as the different probabilities of occurrence and the extent of the threat to the rights and freedoms of natural persons.

The measures include, in particular, ensuring the confidentiality, integrity and availability of data by controlling physical and electronic access to the data as well as the access, entry, disclosure, assurance of availability and separation of the data. We also have procedures in place to ensure the exercise of data subjects' rights, the deletion of data, and responses to data compromise. Furthermore, we already take the protection of personal data into account in the development and selection of hardware, software and procedures in accordance with the principle of data protection, through technology design and through data protection-friendly default settings.

SSL encryption (https): To protect your data transmitted via our online offer, we use SSL encryption. You can recognise such encrypted connections by the prefix https:// in the address line of your browser.

# Transmission of personal data
In the course of our processing of personal data, it may happen that the data is transferred to or disclosed to other bodies, companies, legally independent organisational units or persons. The recipients of this data may include, for example, service providers commissioned with IT tasks or providers of services and content that are integrated into a website. In such cases, we observe the legal requirements and, in particular, conclude appropriate contracts or agreements that serve to protect your data with the recipients of your data.

# Data processing in third countries
If we process data in a third country (i.e., outside the European Union (EU), the European Economic Area (EEA)) or the processing takes place in the context of the use of third-party services or the disclosure or transfer of data to other persons, entities or companies, this will only be done in accordance with the legal requirements.

Subject to express consent or contractually or legally required transfer, we only process or allow data to be processed in third countries with a recognised level of data protection, contractual obligation through so-called standard protection clauses of the EU Commission, in the presence of certifications or binding internal data protection regulations (Art. 44 to 49 GDPR, information page of the EU Commission: https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection_en).

# Deletion of data
The data processed by us will be deleted in accordance with the legal requirements as soon as their consents permitted for processing are revoked or other permissions cease to apply (e.g. if the purpose of processing this data has ceased to apply or it is not required for the purpose).

If the data are not deleted because they are required for other and legally permissible purposes, their processing is limited to these purposes. This means that the data is blocked and not processed for other purposes. This applies, for example, to data that must be retained for reasons of commercial or tax law or whose storage is necessary for the assertion, exercise or defence of legal claims or for the protection of the rights of another natural or legal person.

Our privacy notices may also contain further information on the retention and deletion of data, which will take precedence for the processing operations in question.

# Provision of the online offer and web hosting
In order to provide our online offer securely and efficiently, we use the services of one or more web hosting providers from whose servers (or servers managed by them) the online offer can be accessed. For these purposes, we may use infrastructure and platform services, computing capacity, storage space and database services as well as security services and technical maintenance services.

The data processed in the context of the provision of the hosting offer may include all information relating to the users of our online offer, which is generated in the context of use and communication. This regularly includes the IP address, which is necessary to be able to deliver the contents of online offers to browsers, and all entries made within our online offer or from websites.
* **Types of data processed:** Content data (e.g. entries in online forms); Usage data (e.g. websites visited, interest in content, access times); Meta/communication data (e.g. device information, IP addresses).
* **Data subjects:** Users (e.g. website visitors, users of online services).
* **Purposes of processing:** provision of our online offer and user experience; provision of contractual services and customer service.
* **Legal basis:** Legitimate interests (Art. 6 para. 1 cl. 1 lit. f.GDPR).

**Further guidance on processing operations, procedures and services:**

* **E-mail dispatch and hosting:** The web hosting services we use also include the dispatch, receipt and storage of e-mails. For these purposes, the addresses of the recipients and senders as well as further information regarding the e-mail dispatch (e.g. the providers involved) and the contents of the respective e-mails are processed. The aforementioned data may also be processed for the purpose of identifying SPAM. Please note that e-mails on the Internet are generally not sent in encrypted form. As a rule, e-mails are encrypted in transit, but (unless a so-called end-to-end encryption method is used) not on the servers from which they are sent and received. We can therefore not assume any responsibility for the transmission path of the e-mails between the sender and the reception on our server.
* **Collection of access data and log files:** We ourselves (or our web hosting provider) collect data on each access to the server (so-called server log files). The server log files may include the address and name of the web pages and files accessed, date and time of access, data volumes transferred, notification of successful access, browser type and version, the user's operating system, referrer URL (the previously visited page) and, as a rule, IP addresses and the requesting provider. The server log files may be used on the one hand for security purposes, e.g. to prevent server overload (especially in the event of abusive attacks, so-called DDoS attacks) and on the other hand to ensure the utilization of the servers and their stability; **deletion of data:** Log file information is stored for a maximum period of 30 days and then deleted or anonymized. Data whose further storage is necessary for evidentiary purposes is exempt from deletion until the final clarification of the respective incident.
* **Content Delivery Network:** We use a "content delivery network" (CDN). A CDN is a service with the help of which the content of an online offer, in particular large media files such as graphics or program scripts, can be delivered faster and more securely with the help of regionally distributed servers connected via the Internet.
* **Netlify.com:** hosting platform for websites and services in the field of provision of information technology infrastructure and related services (e.g. storage space, content delivery network and/or computing capacity) **Service Provider:** Netlify Inc, 610 22nd Street Suite 315 San Francisco, CA 94107 United States; **website:** https://www.netlify.com; **privacy policy:** https://www.netlify.com/privacy/; **data processing agreement:** signed with provider

The answering of contact inquiries as well as the administration of contact and inquiry data in the context of contractual or pre-contractual relations is carried out for the fulfillment of our contractual obligations or for the answering of (pre)contractual inquiries and, moreover, on the basis of the legitimate interests in answering the inquiries and maintaining user or business relations.

# Presence in social networks (social media)
We maintain online presences within social networks and process user data in this context in order to communicate with users of these networks or to offer information about us.

We would like to point out that user data may be processed outside the European Union. This may result in risks for the users, because, for example, the enforcement of the rights of the users could be made more difficult.

Furthermore, the data of users within social networks is usually processed for market research and advertising purposes. For example, usage profiles can be created based on the usage behavior and resulting interests of the users. The usage profiles can in turn be used, for example, to place advertisements within and outside the networks that presumably correspond to the interests of the users. For these purposes, cookies are usually stored on the computers of the users, in which the usage behavior and the interests of the users are stored. Furthermore, data independent of the devices used by the users may also be stored in the usage profiles (especially if the users are members of the respective platforms and are logged in to them).

For a detailed description of the respective forms of processing and the possibilities of objection (opt-out), we refer to the data protection declarations and information provided by the operators of the respective networks.

Also in the case of requests for information and the assertion of data subject rights, we point out that these can be asserted most effectively with the providers. Only the providers have access to the users' data and can take appropriate measures and provide information directly. If you still need help, you can contact us.

* **Types of data processed:** contact data (e.g. e-mail, telephone numbers); content data (e.g. entries in online forms); usage data (e.g. websites visited, interest in content, access times); meta/communication data (e.g. device information, IP addresses).
* **Data subjects:** Users (e.g. website visitors, users of online services).
* **Purposes of processing:** contact requests and communication; feedback (e.g. collecting feedback via online form); marketing.
* **Legal basis:** Legitimate interests (Art. 6 para. 1 cl. 1 lit. f.GDPR).

# Plugins and embedded functions and content
We integrate functional and content elements into our online offer that are obtained from the servers of their respective providers (hereinafter referred to as "third-party providers"). These can be, for example, graphics, videos or city maps (hereinafter uniformly referred to as "content").

The integration always requires that the third-party providers of this content process the IP address of the user, since without the IP address they could not send the content to their browser. The IP address is thus required for the display of this content or function. We strive to only use content whose respective providers use the IP address only to deliver the content. Third-party providers may also use so-called pixel tags (invisible graphics, also known as "web beacons") for statistical or marketing purposes. The "pixel tags" can be used to evaluate information such as visitor traffic on the pages of this website. The pseudonymous information may also be stored in cookies on the user's device and may contain, among other things, technical information about the browser and operating system, referring websites, time of visit and other information about the use of our online offer as well as be linked to such information from other sources.

**Notes on legal bases:** Where we ask users for their consent to use third-party providers, the legal basis for processing data is consent. Otherwise, users' data is processed on the basis of our legitimate interests (i.e. interest in efficient, economical and recipient-friendly services). In this context, we would also like to refer you to the information on the use of cookies in this privacy policy.

* **Types of data processed:** Usage data (e.g. web pages visited, interest in content, access times); Meta/communication data (e.g. device information, IP addresses).
* **Data subjects:** Users (e.g. website visitors, users of online services).
* **Purposes of the processing:** Provision of our online offer and user experience.
* **Legal basis:** Legitimate interests (Art. 6 para. 1 cl. 1 lit. f.GDPR).

**Further guidance on processing operations, procedures and services:**

* **Google Fonts:** Purchase of fonts ("Google Fonts") from the provider Google for the purpose of a technically secure, maintenance-free and efficient use of fonts in terms of timeliness and loading times, their uniform presentation and consideration of possible restrictions under licensing law. Google is informed of the user's IP address so that Google can provide the fonts in the user's browser. In addition, technical data (language settings, screen resolution, operating system, hardware used) are transmitted which are necessary for the provision of the fonts depending on the devices used and the technical environment. ; **Service provider:** Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland, parent company: Google LLC, 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA; **website:** https://fonts.google.com/; **privacy policy:** https://policies.google.com/privacy.

# Modification and updating of the privacy policy
We ask you to regularly inform yourself about the content of our data protection declaration. We adapt the data protection declaration as soon as the changes in the data processing carried out by us make this necessary. We will inform you as soon as the changes require an act of cooperation on your part (e.g. consent) or other individual notification.

Where we provide addresses and contact details of companies and organizations in this privacy statement, please note that the addresses may change over time and please check the details before contacting us.

# Rights of the data subjects

* **Right to object: You have the right to object at any time, on grounds relating to your particular situation, to the processing of personal data concerning you which is carried out on the basis of Article 6(1)(e) or (f) GDPR; this also applies to profiling based on these regulations. If the personal data concerning you is processed for the purpose of direct marketing, you have the right to object at any time to the processing of personal data concerning you for the purpose of such marketing; this also applies to profiling insofar as it is related to such direct marketing.**
* **Right to object consents:** You have the right to revoke any consent you have given at any time.
* **Right of access:** You have the right to obtain confirmation as to whether or not personal data concerning you is being processed and to obtain information about it, as well as further information and a copy of the data, in accordance with the law.
